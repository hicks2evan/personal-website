<h1>About Evan</h1>
<p>
    I'm a software engineer located in Denver, Colorado. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science in
    June of 2018. I'm currently a consultant with
    <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs">VMware Tanzu (formerly Pivotal) Labs.</a>
    If you are here, I'm assuming you want to learn more "about me".
    For that reason, I'll take the liberty of trying to tell a full story below.
</p>

<h2>High school</h2>
<p>
    I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico (I was in high school during the time that Breaking Bad was released).
    I was an arts and humanities geek. To give you an idea, I medaled on the
    <a href="https://www.nle.org/">National Latin Exam</a>,
    I was president of the Spanish Honors Society at my high school, and my first job was stacking books at the
    Albuquerque Public Library.
    I was addicted to puzzles and brainteasers. My school's librarian printed out copies of the New York Times and LA Times
    crosswords daily, I tried to visit to pick up a copy to solve every day. I loved drawing cartoons and I tried to
    create a graphic novel for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-evt0NIiEk">senior project</a>
    (I succeeded at completing two short chapters).
</p>

<h2>University of Denver</h2>
<p>
    When I left Albuquerque, I knew I wanted to continue interdisciplinary scholarship, so I pursued enrollment in a
    liberal arts college. I also knew I wanted to learn some practical skills, and hopefully keep drawing pictures. I
    started at the University of Denver (DU) in 2014 seeking an animation/game degree. I created a comic strip for
    the student newspaper, <a href="https://duclarion.com/"><i>"The DU Clarion"</i></a>, and also took my
    first computer programming class my first year.
</p>
<p>
    I liked working on computer programs. My assignments reminded me of logic puzzles, and they were just
    as gratifying to complete correctly. In my second year, I started working outside of school in an
    after-school program teaching elementary students coding. I would stick with that job through graduation.
    Programming was my new addiction. I shirked a lot of the art requirements for my animation/game degree
    in order to take more computer science classes.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond computing coursework, I also continued my interest in language and took several higher level credits in Spanish.
    The upper Spanish coursework at DU assumed language proficiency and focused on writing and conversation around Spanish
    and Latin American regional arts, literature, and history. I lived and studied in Barcelona in my third year, and
    created a <a href="https://diadotgram.wordpress.com/">cartoon blog</a> for DU's study abroad program documenting my
    experience living in a foreign country and learning a foreign language.
</p>
<p>
    The following summer I interned with Vail Resorts in their digital retail group. I worked on a team with two other
    interns to create an internal tool for graphic designers and developers to manage SCSS style definitions for ski
    resort web applications. I'm told our tool is still used today and has cut down the time it took to style a new ski
    resort website (like when Vail <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/08/489244335/vail-resorts-to-buy-canadas-whistler-blackcomb-for-1-06-billion">
    acquired Whistler Blackcomb</a> in 2016) from around a month down to a few hours.
</p>
<p>
    While registering for my classes in the first semester of my fourth year, my advisor informed me I couldn't
    take any more C.S. classes without exceeding the limit for my B.A. degree. I was really hoping to take some
    additional courses like parallel/distributed computing and programming languages. When I asked him if
    there was anything I could do, he informed me that the only thing standing between me and a B.S. in C.S.
    was about a year of Calculus. I did a year of Calculus and now I'm a "computer
    scientist".

<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>
    I graduated from DU in June of 2018 and went to work for Charles Schwab as a developer on a team that
    works on cloud microservices to support some business functions like billing, offer management, and
    reporting for an <a href="https://intelligent.schwab.com/">automated investing product</a> (RoboAdvisor).
    As a developer for a large financial services firm, I was able to dive deeper into the unique challenges
    facing financial technology. I learned a lot about web application security and financial regulatory requirements.
    I also got to observe how distributed systems evolve at scale.
</p>
<p>
    In March of 2020 (amidst a global pandemic), I left Charles Schwab to join
    <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs/">VMware Tanzu Labs</a>.
    I now work with clients consulting on test-driven development, Extreme Programming, and cloud native application development.
    I spend my day-to-day pairing with other software developers, product designers, and product managers, sharing with them
    how having a testing mindset can improve the design code and provide confidence in the quality and value of the products
    they deliver.
</p>
<p>
    I work in 3-6 months units, so I have gotten to work on multiple projects across industries, enterprises and
    startups. To name a couple, I worked with CVS to migrate a massive batch rebates process off of a literal mainframe
    (right?) onto Java <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch">Spring Batch</a> applications. Shortly after I
    helped a YC graduate company launch an
    <a href="https://webflow.com/feature/made-in-webflow-launch">updated showcase experience</a>
    for their creator marketplace using
    <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering">Next.js' SSR capabilities</a>
    to boost SEO performance. I like getting to work in new domains and programming languages often,
    and I work with such fantastic people :)

<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>
    This site exists to showcase my work and as a platform for publishing content on the things that
    interest me. Lately Iâ€™m spending a lot of time thinking about how we use language, drawings, and examples
    (tests) to abstractly communicate how things work in spaces increasingly devoid of physical things.
    It's also my excuse to keep drawing cartoons. Thanks for visiting!
