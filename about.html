<h1>About Evan</h1>
<p>
    I'm a software engineer and cartoonist located in Denver, Colorado. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science in
    June of 2018. I'm currently a consulting Software Engineer with VMware Tanzu (formerly Pivotal) Labs.
    If you are here, I'm assuming you want to learn more "about me".
    For that reason, I'll take the liberty of trying to tell a full story below.
</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>
    I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico (I was in high school during the time that Breaking Bad was released).
    I was an arts and humanities geek. To give you an idea, I medaled on the National Latin Exam, I was
    president of the Spanish Honors Society, and my first job was stacking books at the public library. I loved
    puzzles and brainteasers. My school's librarian printed out copies of the New York Times and LA Times
    crosswords daily, I tried to visit to pick up a copy every day. I loved drawing cartoons and I tried to
    create a graphic novel for my senior project (I succeeded at completing two short chapters).
</p>
<p>
    When I left Albuquerque, I knew I wanted to continue my interdisciplinary scholarship at a liberal arts
    college. I also knew I wanted to learn some practical skills, and hopefully keep drawing pictures. I
    enrolled at the University of Denver in 2014 pursuing an animation/game degree. I started a comic strip for
    the student newspaper, <a href="https://duclarion.com/"><i>The Clarion</i></a>, that year, and also took my
    first programming class.
</p>
<p>
    I liked working on computer programs. My assignments were reminded me of logic puzzles, and they were just
    as gratifying to complete correctly. In my second year, I started working outside of school in an
    after-school program teaching elementary students coding. I would stick with that job through graduation.
    Programming was my new addiction. I shirked a lot of the art requirements for my animation/game degree
    in order to take more computer science classes.
</p>
<p>
    In my third year, I studied abroad in Barcelona. I created a <a href="https://diadotgram.wordpress.com/">cartoon
    blog</a> for my University's study abroad program about my time there. During that time, I took it upon
    myself to learn some web development skills in hopes of landing an internship. That summer I interned with
    Vail Resorts in their digital retail group. I worked on a team with two other interns to create an internal
    tool for graphic designers and developers to manage SCSS style definitions for ski resort applications.
</p>
<p>
    While registering for my classes in the first semester of my fourth year, my advisor informed me I couldn't
    take any more C.S. classes without exceeding the limit for my B.A. degree. I was really hoping to take some
    higher-level courses like parallel/distributed computing and programming languages. When I asked him if
    there was anything I could do, he informed me that the only things standing between me and a B.S. in C.S.
    were some C.S. coursework and about a year of Calculus. I did a year of Calculus and now I'm a "computer
    scientist".
</p>
<p>
    I graduated from DU in June of 2018 and went to work for Charles Schwab as a developer on a team that
    works on cloud microservices to support some business functions like billing, offer management, and
    reporting for an <a href="https://intelligent.schwab.com/">automated investing product</a> (RoboAdvisor).
    As a developer for a large financial services firm, I was able to dive deeper into web application security
    and see how distributed systems evolve at scale.
</p>
<p>
    In March of 2020 (amidst a global pandemic), I left Charles Schwab to join
    <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs/">VMware Tanzu Labs</a>. I now work with clients consulting on Test
    Driven Development, Extreme Programming, and cloud native application development. I spend my day-to-day
    pairing with other software developers and sharing with them how tests and pairing can be used to improve
    the design of the code they write and provide confidence in the quality of the product they deliver.

<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p>
    This site exists to showcase my work and as a platform for publishing content on the things that
    interest me. Lately Iâ€™m spending a lot of time thinking about how we use language, drawings, and examples
    (tests) to abstractly communicate how things work in spaces increasingly devoid of physical things.
    It's also my excuse to keep drawing cartoons. Thanks for visiting!
